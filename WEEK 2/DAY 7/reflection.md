# Day 7 Reflection

## Successes
- Learned PostgreSQL role management for users and groups.
- Understood detailed privilege granting and revocation.
- Implemented and tested effective row-level security policies.
- Improved security awareness for production deployments.

## Challenges

- Default privileges behavior can be overlooked without explicit configuration.

## Key Takeaways
- Security is foundational; always enforce least privilege.
- Group-based roles reduce administrative overhead.
- RLS enables granular data security beyond traditional permissions.
