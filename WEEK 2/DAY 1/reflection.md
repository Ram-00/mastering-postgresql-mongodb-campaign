# Day 1 Reflection

## What Went Well
- Successfully normalized a complex dataset from scratch
- Junction tables for M:N relationships make perfect sense now
- Foreign key cascades provide elegant solutions for data integrity
- Complex multi-table joins are becoming more intuitive

## Challenges Faced
- Initially confused about when to use CASCADE vs RESTRICT
- Composite primary keys in junction tables required careful thinking
- Balancing normalization with query performance considerations

## Key Insights
- Normalization is about eliminating anomalies, not just reducing redundancy
- Every foreign key decision should align with business rules
- Junction tables are essential for proper M:N modeling
- Schema design impacts both data integrity and query complexity

## Industry Applications
- E-commerce platforms use exactly these patterns
- Understanding normalization helps with database optimization
- Proper foreign key design prevents data corruption
- These concepts scale to enterprise-level applications

## Next Steps
- Want to explore denormalization strategies for read-heavy workloads
- Curious about performance implications of deep joins
- Ready to dive into advanced constraint types and triggers
