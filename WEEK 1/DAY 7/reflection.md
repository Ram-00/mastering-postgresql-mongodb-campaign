# Day 7 Reflection and Weekly Progress Review

## What Went Well
- Practiced foundational database design and CRUD skills every day.
- Demonstrated problem-solving when handling errors and enforcing integrity.

## What Needs Work
- Need to practice joining tables and more advanced queries.
- Plan to spend a little extra time next week on normalization and relationships.

## Plan for Next Week
- Read ahead on Week 2 topics: normalization, foreign keys, and JOINs.
- Keep pushing all code and notes to GitHub.

**Summary:**  
This week provided a strong base for using PostgreSQL in any real-world or interview scenario. Constraints, careful data modeling, and robust CRUD skills are now part of my toolset!
